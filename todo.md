To be done:

- detect user solution
- show solution
- add a header
  - make easy 'start game here' button
  - make 'see solution' button
  - style header
- locally cache the raw company html fragments
- show progress bar during solution
- keep track of connections (people) for solution
- check and report time elapsed for game
- make advanced form where you can specify end (w no guarantees)
- use a 3rd party service so that people can share games
- make deadend info cached (in localstorage) so it can be re-used
- add a countdown?

Questions:

- should the code detect when you've seen the final company?
  - if yes, should it do so when you've navigated there? or can see it?

Done:

- display the connection mechanisms per company
- display the ranks of each associated company
- make setup + start game templates
- generate valid solution
- hook in setup + start game pages to be functional
